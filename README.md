version test

ONLY DOFUS 2.0 for now

to start 

`
git clone https://github.com/Mrpotatosse/abricot.git
cd abricot
npm install
npm start
`

You just have to launch Dofus from Ankama launcher. The injector will analyse every instance launched.
NOTE: the program will execute another instance of dofus and close the one started by the Ankama Launcher.
it's an automatic process and it's required by the program to ensure that not packet will be lost.

For now the content of every packet is not parsed ( I'll add it later )
